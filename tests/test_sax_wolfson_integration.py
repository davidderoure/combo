"""Integration tests for ensemble/sax.py against the real Wolfson-adapted model —
DESIGN.md §12, Phase 8. First test file in this codebase needing a binary artifact
absent from a fresh clone: skips cleanly if ensemble/wolfson/models/sax_best.pt
hasn't been copied in (gitignored — see README). Runs real inference throughout,
matching this codebase's no-mocking norm — measured ~11ms/call on CPU, fast enough
that faking it would be needless."""
